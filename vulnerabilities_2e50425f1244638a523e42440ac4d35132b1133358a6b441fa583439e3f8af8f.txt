Relevant code:
<form action="/login" method="post">
Description: The login form does not implement any anti-CSRF tokens. This could potentially allow an attacker to forge a request on behalf of a user.
Severity: High
Fix: Implement anti-CSRF tokens in the form. This can be done by generating a unique token for each session and including it as a hidden field in the form. The server should then verify this token on each POST request.
